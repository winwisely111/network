# GRPC

It woudl be great of GPRC can work for Web, Desktop and Mobile

HINT : Flutter web requires the server to serve gRPC-Web

- This would also mean on the Desktop and Web that we could use this between the forground and background app,
and so allow a long running background app to always be there independnet of the foreground app
- The transport is then just http and we then dont have to get into sticky IPC which is very OS specific
